Roadmap for BSV incubator and ecosystem

BA Hackathon II 17-19th of August 2020

In lack of vision, money will always be the default driver. 

Fork of 500 BSV in a tokenized contract for 100 seedlings at 5 BSV per seddling. Why fork off? Create independent value useable only inside the ecosystem.   

Set the seedling value at $ 100 per BSV, anything over $ 100 will be place in a security token for cashpooling. 5 % interest on 36 months contracts. Tokenized+HandCash or similar setup.

Cashpooling
Why have your money in a bank that only speculates at your risk and gives you no interest? Why not send all your money to your personal ID XFA email directly from payroll system, directly connected with HandCash, Tax Office, 80 % of all automated payments, access to cashpool of 20 % for various activities.

Have investors settle on 5 % 36 month microloans as max. The less interest an investor demands the higher social score.
Microfinance projects for invalidation, give money for research and idea exploration, if invalidated give bonus for reducing wasteful resource distribution.
